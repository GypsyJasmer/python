Quiz #1
Solution to Quiz 1 162P
Question 1: A named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation is a:
The correct answer is: function
Question 2: A parameter is:
a. a name used in the function definition to refer to a value that will be provided when the function is called
b. used to create a function that is more flexible since it can respond to its inputs
c. inside parenthesis after the function name in the header line of the function definition
d. all of the above
The correct answer is: all of the above
Question 3: A statement that creates a new function, specifying its name, parameters and the statements it executes is a:
The correct answer is: function definition
Question 4: A statement that executes or invokes a function is a:
The correct answer is: function call
Question 5: A variable used inside a function is:
a. is called a local variable
b. has a lifetime of the function call. It is created when the function is called and destroyed when the function returns.
c. can be used by name only within the function. A variable by the same name outside the function is a different variable.
d. all of the above
The correct answer is: all of the above
Question 6: A ______________ is a special variable that is declared on the header line of a function definition and receives a piece of data when a function is called
The correct answers is: parameter
Question 7: The first line of a function that shows its name and parameters is known as a
The correct answer is: header line
Question 8: A ___________ is a value that is sent into a function when the function is called. This value gets substituted in for the corresponding parameter in the parameter list.
The correct answer is: argument
Question 9: You ____________ a function to execute it.
The correct answer is: call
Question 10: The body of a function is delimited by
The correct answer is: the indentation of each line of the body

QUIZ #2
Solution to Quiz 2 162P
Question 1: A recursive solution to a problem is always faster and more efficient than an iterative solution.
The correct answer is: False
Question 2: A recursive function:
a. must call itself
b. must have a base case that does not call itself
c. each recursive call must "move toward" the base case
d. must return true or false
The correct answers are: must call itself, must have a base case that does not call itself, each recursive call must "move toward" the base case
Question 3: A recursive algorithm is often easier to understand than the equivalent iterative algorithm
The correct answer is: True
Question 4: Recursive functions must always have parameters
The correct answer is: True
Question 5: It is always possible to rewrite a recursive algorithm as an iterative one.
The correct answer is: True

QUIZ #3
Question 1: The operator used to assess an individual element in a list is:
a.	the index operator
b.	[]
c.	()
d.	both choices a and b
The correct answer is: both choices a and b
Question 2:  Given the list a = [1, 3, 5]; the following statement will remove 3 from the list:
The correct answer is: del a[1]
Is this a good question?  Given how rarely del is used, is this how they would remove the element?  I’m sure there are other ways to do it.  Probably splicing or something
Question 3: This method can be used to calculate the number of elements in the list l:
The correct answer is: len(l)
Question 4: Given the list a = [1, 3, 5], the statement b = a
The correct answer is: creates an alias called b to the list stored in a. There is just one list with two names.
Question 5: You can create a copy of list a and store it in list b by executing
The correct answer is: b = a[:]
Question 6: If you want to sum up the elements of a list l, you could
The correct answers are: use a for loop stepping through the elements, use the sum(l) method
# semi misleading since you have this as a select 1, but also entirely accurate.  Might be better reworded, guessing sum is the answer you initially wanted, perhaps “the built in method to…” or something?
Question 7: Given list a = [1, 3, 5, 7], the statement b = a[2:] results in
The correct answer is: [5, 7]
Question 8: Given the list a [ 1, 3, 5], b = 3 * a results in
The correct answer is: [1, 3, 5, 1, 3, 5, 1, 3, 5]
Question 9: Given the two lists a = [1, 3, 5] and b = [2, 4, 6] c = a + b would result in
The correct answer is: [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6]
Question 10: Given the two lists a = [1, 3, 5] and b = [2, 4, 6], a[1] = b would result in
The correct answer is: [1, [2, 4, 6], 5]

QUIZ #4

Solution to Quiz 5 162P
Question 1: The best choice for validation is:
A while loop.
When validating input, you want to keep getting input from the user until they get it right.
Question 2: You should always validate input before using it throughout your program.
True
If you fail to validate input, it may cause your program to function incorrectly.
Question 3: The best way to program is to use a few functions that each do many things.
False
Each function should do one thing and do it well.
Question 4: A variable must be defined in main before you can use it locally in a function.
False
Variables local to a function should be define in that function, unless they are parameters.
Question 5: In the following function definition, what does size = 4 signify? def area(size = 4):
The parameter size has a default value of 4. If no argument is provided in a call to this function, the default value will be used.
Question 6: When you call a function with multiple parameters, it matters what order you provide the values in.
True
Arguments are assigned to parameters left to right. The leftmost argument is stored in the leftmost parameter and so forth.
Question 7: When we want to see if something will work or if it will terminate with an error, we use which of these?
try/except
If an exception occurs in the execution of the try block, the code in the except block is performed. If no exception occurs, the except block is skipped.
Question 8: Python allows you to define some items as constants that can never be changed.
False
Python does not have constants; all values are variable and can be changed at will.
Question 9: When defining some values to be constants in Python, the convention is to (select all that are true).
a. place them in constant.py
b. place them at the top of your program
c. use an uppercase naming convention BIG_NUM
d. use lower cases, so you are not shouting at the user
The correct answers are a and c.
Question 10: Instead of dealing with the hassle of defining parameters in functions and passing them, we should always use global variables.
False
You never want to use global variables, their use can contribute to programs that are impossible to debug and maintain.

2. An object is a software entity that combines both data and PROCEDURES in a single unit.

3.Creating a class object is often called the INSTANTIATION of a class. 

4. Each method or function in a class must include the SELF parameter.
